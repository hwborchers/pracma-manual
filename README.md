# R Package pracma

The *pracma* packege provides a large number of functions from 
numerical analysis and linear algebra, numerical optimization, 
differential equations, time series, plus some well-known special 
mathematical functions.  
Uses 'MATLAB' function names where appropriate to simplify porting.
